## General Approach

I wanted to practice using a front-end framwork with Ember.js.  I understood the overall concept of using models, routes, and componenets to construct modular and responsive websites, but solutions to particular problems I was having proved much more difficult.  Most of my time was not spent building the site but in doing research on how to build out further.

Overall, I was happy with my approach and completion of tasks I set out for myself, they just took much longer than I anticipated.  In the future, I won't take it for granted that I can quickly pick up a new and unfamiliar technology.

## User Stories

-  As a user, I want to see what pokemon there are
-  As a user, I want to see what types pokemon are
- As a user, I want to know what types/pokemon are effective against other types/pokemon
- As a user, I'd like to create a team of pokemon to see how they would fare against other random pokemon

## Technologies

- Ember.js
- Ember-charts

## Installation

-  npm install && bower install

## TODOs

-  More information on individual pokemon pages
- Implement user comments and ratings on pokemon
- Improve styling all around, especially the stat charts
- Transition animations between view states

Reach goals:
- Type matchup information (grass is weak to fire, etc)
- Quiz section where you are asked questions based

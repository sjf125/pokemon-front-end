# Pokedexter

An app to explore and memorize pokemon.

## General Approach

I wanted to practice using a front-end framwork with Ember.js.  I understood the overall concept of using models, routes, and componenets to construct modular and responsive websites, but solutions to particular problems I was having proved much more difficult.  Most of my time was not spent building the site but in doing research on how to build out further.

Overall, I was happy with my approach and completion of tasks I set out for myself, they just took much longer than I anticipated.  In the future, I won't take it for granted that I can quickly pick up a new and unfamiliar technology.

## User Stories
